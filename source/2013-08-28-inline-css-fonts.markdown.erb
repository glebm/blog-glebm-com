If you serve web fonts via URL, the browsers makes a separate request for every font.

Fonts in stylesheet in head cause 1 extra request that only starts when the containing CSS is retrieved and processed.
Referencing fonts from body causes a flash of missing text or font change flash, and requires JS work around for most browsers.

However, you can avoid extra requests *and* rendering issues if you inline the fonts as data-uris.

Inline web fonts with this script:

<% code 'bash' do %>
# download inliner and mark it as executable
curl https://gist.github.com/glebm/6360088 > inline-css-font.rb; chmod +x inline-css-font.rb
# provide URL or path to convert
./inline-css-font.rb 'https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Arimo:400'
<% end %>

[The script][inline-css-font.rb] replaces all the `url` values with data-uris in `woff` format.
The fonts are now delivered in 1 request together with CSS and the rendering is perfect, no more FOUC or font change.


### There be dragons

* file size +33% due to base64, not so much when gzipped
* when there are more fonts files at some point it is faster to download them in parallel. This depends on the font sizes and latency / bandwidth of the audience.
* public CDN files may already be in browser cache (e.g. the most popular Google Web Fonts)
* this inlines woff format, [supported][caniuse-woff] everywhere but IE 8 and stock Anroid Browser

Most individual font sizes are in 10 - 20 KB range; if you only use a few font files this could easily cut down initial load times by 5-20%. *YMMV!*
As usual, the key is measuring.

Alternatively, you could try using [Google Page Speed Module][mod-pagespeed], which may intellegently apply this and other optimizations but has it's own drawbacks.
