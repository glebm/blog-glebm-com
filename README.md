## Set up

Fork this repo. After cloning your fork:

    # remove all existing posts:
    rm -f source/2*.markdown.erb
    rm -rf source/images/2*/
    git add -u
    git commit -m "remove @glebm's posts"
    
Then change the following files with your data:

* `data/disqus.yml` -- remove or change disqus key
* `data/google_analytics.yml` -- remove or change analytics account id
* `source/CNAME` -- remove file or change to your CNAME (this is for gh-pages)

The rest of the settings are in other files in `data/`. See `config.rb` for advanced configuration.
  
To update to the latest upstream with:
  
    # add upstream -- only need to do this once 
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/glebm/blog-glebm-com
    # pull upstream changes, and apply your changes on top
    git pull --rebase upstream/master


## Workflow

* `middleman` to start development server
* `middleman article TITLE` to generate a new article
* `rake build` to test build
* `rake publish` to publish (builds and pushes to gh-pages branch on origin). 

#### Articles

Articles are written in markdown and also processed with `<%= ERB %>`. Add `published: false` to the YAML bit in the beginning of the article to make it a draft. 

#### Images

    <%= image_tag 'image_name.png' %>
    <img src="/images/image_name.png">

    <%= article_image_tag 'image_name.png' %>
    <img src="/images/2016-01-01-my-article-slug/image_name.png">

#### Icons

    <%= glyphicon('play') %>
    <i class='glyphicon glyphicon-play'></i>

#### Summary / read more:

If the article contains `READMORE`, the part above `READMORE` will be considered a summary, and will be rendered on the index page with a "Read more" link after it.
